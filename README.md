# ARMhackathon2016 - GPS glove
Developed By Kamile Matulenaite, Michael Tang, Joshua Wong and Soo Wah Ming Wayne at the ARM Hackathon hosted by the Engineering Society at the University of Cambridge in October 2016.

The Android app uses the Google Maps and Places API to get cycling directions from the user's start location to an end location. Direction data can be sent and compiled onto a BBC:microbit that can signal left and right turns by vibration on left and right-most fingers within a glove, allowing for safer cycling.
